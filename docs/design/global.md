## 2. Core Gameplay Loop

**Time Structure:**  
The game uses a real-world calendar and clock system, broken into 15-minute intervals. Time management is central to
gameplay — each action, movement, or activity consumes time.

**Daily Routine:**

- The player character wakes up at 6 AM, prepares, and attends classes starting at 7 AM.
- Classes follow a predefined schedule that changes by year.
- During classes, the player chooses actions (e.g. studying or socializing), impacting stats and relationships.
- Breaks between classes allow for brief social or leisure interactions.
- After school, the player has limited leisure time for activities or meeting others.
- The player must return to the dorm by 9 PM, enjoy a final hour of dorm leisure, and sleep at 10 PM (enforced).

**Game Systems Active During a Day:**

- **Classroom RPG Mechanics:** Players engage in a turn-based system mimicking battles — managing focus, avoiding
  detection, and choosing how to engage.
- **Stat Management:** Players must monitor energy, stress, mood, and relationship progress.
- **Location Movement:** Players can visit areas of the school and town, with travel consuming time.
- **Dialogue & Social Interaction:** Choosing who to spend time with or talk to affects long-term relationship arcs.

**Player Planning:**
Players can:

- Choose items to carry.
- Decide how to spend class and leisure time.
- Prioritize which characters to engage with.
- Manage schedule based on known events and availability.

**Goals:**

- **Short-term:** Maintain energy and mood, avoid burnout, build relationships.
- **Long-term:** Pass school years, score high on exams, and succeed in the final maturity exam.
