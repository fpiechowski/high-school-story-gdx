## 🔧 Implementation Notes

- Many events unlock **cutscenes**, **new dialogue options**, or **special stat modifiers**.
- Major trips may **suspend normal schedule** for 2–3 days.
- Certain events (e.g. Valentine’s Day) **require minimum relationship levels** to access full content.
- Random classroom or club-based mini-events can be inserted on weeks without fixed events for pacing.
